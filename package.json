so first things first. Its important for me, i gotta build a resume, and cover letter, bas
  on my Web Developer expirience which is not rich. I accomlished Full Stack Courses (with 1
  year duration) started in 2022 until 2024, it was august. In that moment i realized that i
  100 percent wanna build a career here, in Development. Id started my preparation to get in
  University, finnaly i was admitted last summer, in 2025. This is mi first year for studiyn
  for software engeenier. Im thrilled, realy, i adore of being there, study cool things and
  hone my skills. Im realy craving to find my first role, would it be in front end or backen
  doesnt matter, im high on everithing. Lets back when i was 28, i was awful, hadnt had any
  goals in my life, i didnt know what i want to achieve, where i wanna be and whom. I drunk 
  lot, cause im a carpenter, and its mediocre in this field. One day i woke up, looked in th
  mirror, and realized, it makes me feel nauseous, like totaly, i cant stand myself. And i
  just started, started with the simplest think i could do - quit drinking. After that, i
  enrolled to the 1.5 year Full Stack Developer course, without any expirence in this field,
  without any idea what be able to do, and will i willing to perform anything... First 3
  months were complicated, like really, i'wasnt able to focus my attention more than 30
  minutes per lecture, i feel that my brain is almost dried, physically. I had 2 lectures fo
  3 hours each, new topic each week, a lot of homework, alongside my full time work. I'd bee
  dedicating 20-30 hours per week, i could even not sleep,like totally. And it was just
  HTML/CSS, after complition, i felt some power, i added a little bit of confidence... But
  there's been more - JS. After first month - i felt myself totally useless in this field, i
  couldn believe that i able to achieve the success. Even 1 time i almost quit. But i felt a
  same feeling as back than in that moment in front on mirror - nauseous, i couldn't stood
  myself. And i came back. Came back with kinda power, with some sense of living, i didnt gi
  up. Since that i could solve any task, even if its difficult, i would try 5-10-20-50 times
  until its done. Ive started feel myself unstopable, that im. I completed, JS, than React,
  than Nodejs. I was a Team Leader on the last two projects in that course. One of which her
  in the folder projects, called "AquaBalance". Youll find more. But not all. Aquabalance -
  the most comprehensive project what ive done. So alongside with my DREAM to be a developer
  its to be a fluent in English, almost in the same time with starting learning development,
  started learn English, and in 3 years from A0 im at B2 level, and im still hone my skills,
  theres an comperhensive class in University, and we do a bunch. But since i was a teenager
  i understood that every effort, every your action will reward anyway, like finaly youll ge
  there. I understood due to i was a proffesional billard player, im actuaaly, but ive chang
  the focus like 3 years ago to the development. In billiard, i dedicated 5-7 hours per day,
  5-6 days per week during almost 7 years of my life. I become a champion Of Ukraine,
  Lithuania, won couple championships in Canada, so i now that every effort that you double
  down, will be rewarded. And it will definitely happen for me here, as software developer. 
  i wanna ask you to give me a hand, and build a resume, and cover letter. Recently ive foun
  a role Junior Web Engineer - Vinted Academy. I really wanna get there, i really wanna be
  there. So help me. Research my "projects" folder, to collect info. Be focused on
  AquaBalance, cause its the main one, that juniors-js-projects, and HTML/CSS - IceCream. Lo
  through those projects, dive deep to collect the most comprehensive info about them as you
  can. I need you to help me to create a cover letter and resume, based on everything what i
  told you, what you can find in the my projects, especcially in AquaBalance. I rely on you.
  Help me to get my dream job.
